The Framework Core

The framework core normalizes CSS to get a consistent baseline of styles 
cross-browser, then establishes some simple but key modules and helpers to be 
used in the rest of the site's styling.

The core is not meant to be altered in any way. If you need to change the way 
the core handles a certain style or class, extend it with another declaration 
later in the stylesheet.

Because the core always remains the same, both the admin and client CSS themes 
of the framework share the same exact core. Altering the core would alter the 
sitewide CSS as well as the admin CSS. So...**don't touch the core!**

Normalize

Rather than use a traditional reset stylesheet, we want to leverage default 
browser styles and tweak them to be more consistent across the board. It's the 
differenc between using a shovel versus a bulldozer.

The code for this normalization is taken almost entirely from 
[Normalize.css][ncss] and adjusted to our specific needs.

Presentational Classes

The framework provides some helpful and handy presentational classes that are 
most powerful as quick fixes to spacing, floating, and alignment.
