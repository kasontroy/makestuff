    <li>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</li>
    <li>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</li>
    <li>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
    <li>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</li>
